Profit After Tax &amp; Operating Profit

Below is a link to a dashboard I created to assist with visualizing industry market share for a CAPSIM project.

Industry market share of the following companies Andrews, Baldwin, Chester, Digby, and Ferris per round (year). 
The dashboard can be filtered by company and round. When filter it may require of few seconds for the dashboard to execute the applied filters.
