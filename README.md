The Financials.pdf file is a time series chart to better visualize the Profit After Tax and Operating Profit of a company. The financials were initiailly in a CSV file that was imported into Tableau.

Below is a link to a dashboard I created to assist with visualizing the industry market share for a CAPSIM project. The financial data was in a CSV file that was imported into Tableau for further analysis.

Industry market share of the following companies Andrews, Baldwin, Chester, Digby, and Ferris per round (year). 
The dashboard can be filtered by company and round. When filtering it may require a few seconds for the dashboard to execute the applied filters.
